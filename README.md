# JS-Assessment-Metacrafter

This Repository contain all the work on project NFT collection by MetaCrafters

We will simulate this by writing some JavaScript code that will create an object that represents your NFT and that will hold its metadata. This metadata can be anything you want, so go crazy! An example of this could be values like name, eye color, shirt type, bling, etc. Once you have that, you'll need a variable to store all of your NFTs in. Next, you'll need a function so you can print the details of your epic NFTs to the console.
